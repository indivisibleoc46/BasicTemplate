At our May general meeting, we all took a few moments to write postcards to our Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Dianne Feinstein and Rep Lou Correa, and got them sent off to Washington.   Thanks to everyone who participated to make your voices heard.\

What concerns you most right now?  Grab a postcard and write your own message.   (Tip:  Postcards reach your representatives faster than letters in envelopes because the letters are delayed by extra screening in Washington DC.)
