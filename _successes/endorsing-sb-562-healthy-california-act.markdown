Indivisible OC 46 officially endorses SB 562, the Healthy California Act.\
\
While Donald Trump threatens to undermine and/or repeal the ACA,  we can fight back in California by taking the lead on building a better health care system for all Californians:   Guaranteed Health Care for All.   \
\
SB 562 would create a system that covers everybody with a comprehensive plan, reduces cost, and takes health care decisions out of the hands of for-profit corporations.   Learn more at [healthycaliforniaact.org](healthycaliforniaact.org)\
