At our May monthly meeting, Robin Gurien will share about her work with CodeBlue, phone banking to influence special elections all around the country, toward the effort of flipping house seats blue.  Come hear about her work and how we can be involved. 

We will also discuss plans for a Indivisible booth at OC Pride.  We will take a voluntary collection to raise funds for the cost of the booth, and give you an opportunity to sign up for a shift at the booth.

Lastly, we've heard rumors, (but no specific date) about a Lou Correa Town Hall in "early May".  These things are often announced with very little advanced notice, so we should just be ready at any moment. We hope to take a little bit of time at the meeting to brainstorm questions and come up with a plan for the town hall according to the Indivisible Guide.
