Join Indivisible OC 46, and friends, for our first Phone Bank. If we're going to stop Donald Trump's destructive agenda, flipping the House of Representatives Blue will provide a much-needed check on his power. 

There are special elections throughout the country right now where Red House seats can be flipped. An early win for Jon Ossoff in Georgia will bring momentum to this movement. (With momentum comes money for other Democratic challengers, including four right here in OC.)

Join us to phone bank for Jon Ossoff. Bring your phone, your laptop or Tablet, and your willingness to join in and see how this Code Blue tool can make a difference.

Robin Gurien from CodeBlue spoke at our May meeting and will join us tonight to get us started. This time we will get hands on calling experience. Phone banking can influence special elections all around the country, and Indivisible OC 46 wants to support Code Blues effort of flipping house seats blue.

If you RSVP, we will message you the address/directions to Pat and Dave's house in west Anaheim.
