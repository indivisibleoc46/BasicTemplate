Let's build a tighter Progressives community in Orange County! Join us so that we can all get to know each other a little better and take some time to build our community outside of the rallies, protests, and other important work we are doing. This is an inclusive event and we welcome everyone who supports progressive endeavors here in Orange County. We are also inviting the declared candidates for the OC Congressional Districts so you may be able to meet our future Representatives!\
\
TWW OC will arrive early to stake out a large grass area for all of us. Organizers from various groups will bring tables for food and EZ Ups but it's BYOCB (bring your own chairs and blankets). We will post at the entrance which parking lot we will be closest to and will update this post that morning as well. The event is free but there's an entrance fee to the park of $5 per car.\
\
We are asking people to bring a dish to share.\
\
Please bring the following according to the first letter of your last name:\
Side dish/salad: A-G\
Main dish: H-N\
Drinks: O-T\
Dessert: U-Z\
\
We are also having a donation drive contest at our picnic! Please bring non-perishable food items or new school supplies for the AIDS Services Foundation. Whichever Congressional District collects the most will earn bragging rights!\
