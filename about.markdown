**Welcome to Indivisible OC 46**

**Who We Are**
Welcome residents of the 46th Congressional District (Santa Ana and parts of Anaheim, Orange, and Garden Grove)!

We exist to resist the Trump agenda based on a defensive and local strategy, working through our Members of Congress, inspired by the Indivisible Guide: [IndivisibleGuide.com.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FIndivisibleGuide.com%2F&h=ATOHn221BBCPhXlI-2YqBn_h_fuif5TBfXHlNFfr96C1xVFMj4LOmjWfI2Gc3Kld-GnuTqPvkNJ220vzIZPpTJQ0Z2eWND-Y0zCizY4ytU_c696r2BY6jVrrgS2MGzQhqyFAhN0eww)

We are one chapter of Indivisible OC, which also has chapters in each congressional district in OC ([IndivisibleOC.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FIndivisibleOC.com%2F&h=ATMbpC3UVKrmJrajRwJ8SzPrr5oi4uvtCe1otj75uJuXYuKHaGkqtG7ABnw7jGowOAbKF9DF23gpjz6Sh3vgcezM4goVvlYsXzvfB7ocs48wRRt-cNcR9rb7gsbk4a3m1RtZBg4BWQ)org).

**
Our ****Group Principles**

* Donald Trump’s agenda will take America backwards and must be stopped.

* In order to work together to achieve this goal, we must model the values of inclusion, tolerance and fairness.

* Non-Violence

 

**Strategy Focus**

* A **local** strategy targeting individual Members of Congress (MoCs):  2 Senators, 1 Rep

* A **defensive** approach purely focused on stopping Trump from implementing an agenda based on racism, authoritarianism, and corruption

**Facebook Community Guidelines **

We’d love for you to share!  In order to keep the conversation productive, and action-oriented, these are our Facebook community guidelines

1. Before posting, ask yourself: Is this post intended to inform, spur action, or provoke emotion? If it’s intended to inform or spur action, great! If you are posting because you want someone to feel as mad/sad/frustrated/scared as you are feeling in that moment, it’s probably not a good post.

2. When you post a link or article, always include a comment:   Say why you thought it was worth sharing, how it relates to our group’s work, or what kind of discussion or actions you hope to spark.  

3) For a call to action (#C2A), include relevant information such as:  Bill#, who to call, phone number, deadline (if relevant), what action we want them to take, and why.  

Sample Call to Action:  "Call Rep. Correa at (202) 225-2965 and ask him to vote No on the GOP Health Care Bill, HR 1628.  The House is voting Thursday, March 23rd. This bill would cause 24 million people to lose health coverage, including 185,000 residents of District 46."

4)  We do not permit posting fundraisers, gofundme, etc, unless they are fundraising projects the group has decided to conduct as part of our activism work. 

5)  Treat each other with respect.  Disagree with civility.  Do not engage in name-calling, ad-hominem attacks, etc. 

Posts that violate our community guidelines may be removed by group admins.  Admins may revise these community guidelines from time to time.  


**Getting Involved**

We are a brand new group, and we are in the process of forming committees to work on Actions, Marketing, Publicity, Research, and more.  If something interests you, jump right in.  If you want to plan an action, post about it on Facebook or Slack and get the ball rolling. If you see something that needs doing, volunteer to do it!  Please feel empowered to take leadership. 

**Slack**
Slack is a communication tool that we will use for internal planning and coordinating. As our group grows, we will form channels for different committees or projects.  We need YOU to participate to make it all happen!
Please email [indivisibleOC46@gmail.com](mailto:indivisibleOC46@gmail.com) to be added to our Slack channel.  Include your full name, email, and put SLACK in the subject line.

Slack Getting Started Guide: [https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users)



**Facebook**
The Facebook Group is the hub of our group. It’s where we will post action alerts, meeting announcements and overall group communication.
Our Facebook Group is Closed.  We ask that our members use their best judgment when adding friends to the group so that we can maintain an effective space to share information and ideas.

**Twitter & Instagram  **
Twitter are our public facing communications. This is where we post photos, videos and announcements that we want to share with the media and the public. 

**Meetings**
Our monthly meetings will take place the first Friday of every month from 7-9pm.   Location is TBD.  Check the Facebook Group. *[P.S. If you have access to a free or cheap meeting venue in the district, please speak up]*


**Indivisible OC**
We are the "District 46" chapter of Indivisible OC, which is a county-wide umbrella group with chapters for every other Congressional District in OC. You can find them at [www.indivisibleOC.com](http://www.indivisibleoc.com), and [www.facebook.com/groups/indivisibleOC](http://www.facebook.com/groups/indivisibleOC).  
Indivisible OC holds monthly county-wide meetings the third Sunday of every month, 4:30pm, at The Duck Club in Irvine.
