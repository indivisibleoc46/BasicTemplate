We are Indivisible Orange County, District 46.  Located in the center of Orange County, CA, our district includes the cities of Santa Ana and Anaheim, as well as portions of Orange and Garden Grove. \
While some of us have been involved in advocacy for years, most members of Indivisible OC 46 are new activists. We are all proud Americans that want to protect our democracy. Members of Indivisible OC 46 share the desire to do whatever we can to fight the Trump agenda. 

Check out our our [WELCOME GUIDE ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vo6uvKAedmIvA8KR8uH22DvDpTh1z2X_iCt-N1Elq1U/edit#)for an introduction and lots of resources.\
